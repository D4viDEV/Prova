This is the client, part of Chimèra project; Basically an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_role-playing_game">"OMORPG"</a> (Open sources Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game).<br>
We creating something between a second life and a RPG, on a persistent virtual universe. (Please see our <a href="https://github.com/Nikoh77/Chimera-client/wiki">wiki</a> for more info)

Chimèra differs from all mmorpgs because anyone can join his server (his instance) to the Chimèra Federation as happens in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse">"fediverse"</a>, about social networks like <a href="https://mastodon.social">Mastodon</a>.<br>

We decided to use 2D/Pixel Art graphic style like Chrono Trigger, Star Ocean etc.<br>
We also decided to use <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot 4 Game Engine.</a>
Initially the working group is made up of Italians but anyone can contribute, as long as you forgive me for the bad English I speak ;-)<br>
We need 2d graphics (or ai users like scenario, midjourney and so on) and Godot experts.</p>
<h3>Please don't open an issue for help or understanding requests, that's what our discord server is for:</h3>
