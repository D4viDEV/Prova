# Chimera-client
This is the client, part of Chim√®ra project; an OMORPG (Open Sources Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game).
We want to create a Game in a virtual second life on a persistent World.
For now we decided to use 2D/Pixel Art graphic style like Chrono Trigger, Star Ocean etc.
We use Godot 4 Game Engine.
Initially the working group is made up of Italians but anyone can contribute, as long as you forgive me for the bad English I speak ;-)
We need 2d graphics (or ai users like scenario, midjourney and so on) and Godot experts.
