# Chimera-client</p>
This is the client, part of Chim√®ra project; an OMORPG (Open sources Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game).</br>
We want to create a Game in a virtual second life on a persistent World.</br>
For now we decided to use 2D/Pixel Art graphic style like Chrono Trigger, Star Ocean etc.</br>
We use <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot 4 Game Engine.</a>
Initially the working group is made up of Italians but anyone can contribute, as long as you forgive me for the bad English I speak ;-)</br>
We need 2d graphics (or ai users like scenario, midjourney and so on) and Godot experts.</br>
<h3>Please don't open an issue for help or understanding requests, that's what our discord server is for:</h3>
